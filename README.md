Title: Computer Based Ordering System

In our project, we come up to an computer based ordering system because
some restaurants are using pen and a paper to take an order to the customers.
We want to create an easy access for the customers to get their orders.
The customer will choose what food they want to order,
if the customer wants to change his/her order he/she can remove and replace the order and they will see the total amount of their order.
When the customer is done choosing he/she orders they will click submit.
The counter will receive the orders and they will double check the order
and the waiter will take the payment and the counter will send the order to the kitchen.
All the orders that has been ordered on that day, will be recorded on the admin tab.
